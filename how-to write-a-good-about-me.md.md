title: How to write a good "About Me"
permalink: /about/
---

### Purpose
-------
A good "About Me" page quickly tells visitors who you are, what you do, and why they should care. On GitHub Pages it's also a place to point to projects, contact info, and ways to collaborate.

### Structure (recommended)
-----------------------
1. Short headline — one clear sentence about what you do.
2. Elevator pitch — 2–4 sentences explaining your focus, skills, and what you build.
3. Key projects / links — 3–6 highlights with links to repos or demos.
4. Tools & skills — brief list or inline tags (languages, frameworks, roles).
5. Contact / call to action — preferred contact method and links (email, GitHub, LinkedIn).
6. Optional personal line — one sentence about hobbies or values to humanize the page.

### Tone & length
-------------
- Keep voice consistent with your projects (professional, friendly, or technical).
- Aim for scannable text: short paragraphs and bullet lists.
- Desktop visitors scan quickly — keep the core message above the fold (first screen).
- Include a longer section or separate page for a full bio if needed.

### Accessibility & formatting tips
-------------------------------
- Use headings (h2/h3) and lists for structure.
- Add alt text if you include an image.
- Provide links with clear labels (e.g., "See project: project-name").
- Include machine-readable contact (email link or GitHub handle).

### Examples
--------
##### Short example (one-liner + CTA):

> Software engineer focused on building accessible web apps with React and TypeScript. See my work on GitHub or email me at hello@example.com.

##### Longer example:

> Hi — I'm James, a full-stack developer specializing in developer tools and frontend UX. I build open-source libraries and small utilities that make developer workflows easier. My recent work includes a CLI for local testing and a design-system starter. I enjoy mentoring new contributors and writing technical blog posts. Connect on GitHub or LinkedIn.
